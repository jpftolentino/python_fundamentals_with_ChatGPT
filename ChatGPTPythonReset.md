🐍 Python Fluency Plan (300 Problems, 6 Weeks)
🔹 Distribution

Week 1: Basics & Control Flow (1–50)

Week 2: Strings & Lists (51–100)

Week 3: Dictionaries & Sets (101–150)

Week 4: Functions & Python Features (151–200)

Week 5: Mixed Challenges & Patterns (201–250)

Week 6: Mega Review + Mini Algorithms (251–300)

✅ Revised Daily Flow

Days 1–5 → 8–10 problems/day (new ones).

Day 6 (Review) → 5–8 random problems from the week.

Day 7 (Light) → 3–5 easy/fun problems (like FizzBuzz, simple patterns).

This way, each week = ~50 problems.
