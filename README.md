🟩 Prompt:

I’m continuing my 6-week Python Fluency Plan.
Please generate Week 3: Functions & Python Features (Problems 101–150).

Format it the same way as my previous weeks:

- Clearly numbered questions (like “#101”, “#102”, etc.)
- Each question should have a short example input and output (just like Day 5 examples).
- Group problems into 5 days (Day 1–Day 5).
- Don’t give solutions — only the problem descriptions and examples.
- Match the same clean structure and Markdown style as the Week 2 Day 5 version.

Before the questions, include a Day 1 lesson explaining the key concepts that need to be learned with examples

Let’s start with Day 1 only for now.


✅ Optional Add-ons (depending on what you want next)

You can also include one of these lines at the end to make it even smoother:

If you want a short lesson first:


If you want the full week at once:

Please give all 5 days at once in the same message.

If you want one day at a time:

Let’s start with Week 3 Day 1 only, then I’ll ask for Day 2 later.

Hi ChatGPT, I’m continuing my 6-week Python Fluency Plan.
Please generate Week 3: Functions & Python Features (Problems 101–150).

Format the problems exactly like you did for Week 2 Day 5 —
numbered, cleanly grouped by day, each with an example input/output, and no solutions.

Let’s start with Day 1 only for now.
