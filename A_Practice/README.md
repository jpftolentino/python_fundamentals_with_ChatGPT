# Section A — Stubs with Questions + Tests

- Each `Axx_*.py` file contains function stubs with the **exact question text** as comments.
- Tests provided for **A01–A05** (`test_A01.py`..`test_A05.py`). Run with `python test_A01.py`, etc.
- `test_utils.py` includes helpers for capturing prints and comparing outputs.
- Skeleton stub files with question comments are included for A06–A10 (and can be extended similarly for A11–A20 on request).

## Expected Naming
- A01: a1_p1..a1_p10, a1_r1..a1_r5
- A02: a2_p1..a2_p10, a2_r1..a2_r5
- A03: a3_p1..a3_p10, a3_r1..a3_r5
- A04: q1..q10 / r1..r5 (return-based functions)
- A05: a5_p*, a5_r* (return-based)

> Tip: Keep your solution files in the same directory when running tests.
